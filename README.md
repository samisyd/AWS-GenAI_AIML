Invoke FM (Amazon Titan Model)  for Generating Text (Email Responses) Using Bedrock API

How to use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an email response to a customer who provided negative feedback on the quality of customer service they received from the support engineer. 
In this notebook, We  generate an email with a thank you note based on the customer's previous email. We use the Amazon Titan model using the **Amazon Bedrock API with Boto3 client**.

The prompt used in this task is called a zero-shot prompt. In a zero-shot prompt, you describe the task or desired output to the language model in plain language. 
The model then uses its pre-trained knowledge and capabilities to generate a response or complete the task based solely on the provided prompt.
